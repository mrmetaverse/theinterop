In the unforgiving world of entrepreneurship, it can feel as though you're standing alone on the deck of a ship, marooned in the vast, unending ocean, with an unclear compass of which direction to sail. You possess a vision of a new reality, a land uncharted, that feels so tangible yet is often misunderstood or unseen by those comfortably sailing along familiar routes. 

Technology, the double-edged sword of our age, while being a beacon illuminating unprecedented opportunities, also casts long shadows of exclusion. As it relentlessly pushes the boundaries of the possible, it can inadvertently create a widening chasm that makes the uninitiated feel hopelessly adrift or "too late" to join the voyage.

In the emerging fields of cutting-edge technology such as AI, the sense of being "too late" or "unqualified" is prevalent, particularly for those who've been longing to dip their toes in. This stems, in part, from the confusion that surrounds AI. With various subsets like Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and language models coming into play, it's not surprising that many people struggle to determine *what AI* *is*. 

Starting a business is no walk in the park. Imposter syndrome nips at the heels of many entrepreneurs, especially those just starting their journey. A developer-turned-founder might find themselves grappling with networking, fundraising, and human-centered design, while a seasoned salesperson wishing to pivot into tech may find themselves ensnared in the "if only I had an MVP" trap. Instead of self-flagellation over our skills gaps, we should be leaning into our strengths and supplementing our deficiencies with expert advice. 

But what if you're at the point of ignition, ready to get the ball rolling? This is particularly daunting for platform-based business models, where first-time founders are confronted with the challenge of managing both user and content creator sides. If you want to make a new video streaming service, you have to manage the flow of users watching, and content creators. If you make a Metaverse Inventory System, you have to manage the aggregation of user-generated assets, and the number of platforms that will accept your inventory (ideally you use open standards for interoperability), and generate users who both consume these assets and understand how to access them within the various platforms they experience. That is a lot!

So, what if there was a way to make things a little less overwhelming? What if there was a way to bridge the initial gap, ensuring you don't wander too far down a rabbit hole of impossible solutions? 

Enter your AI co-founder.

Entrepreneurs are harnessing the power of language models to code, unlocking vast potential with tools like [MagickML](https://magickml.com/). As more models emerge, an increasing number of options become available to co-create and manifest projects. MagickML aims to make it easier to build better AI agents, ones that function as extensions of you, tailored to your unique needs. 

&#8220;Absolutely interested, send me your pitch deck and executive summary". This can seem intimidating for a first-time founder. Maybe you're a coding prodigy, able to outperform entire teams singlehandedly but struggle when it comes to creating a pitch deck. It&#8217;s ok, pobodys nerfect. Through prompts and iterations, AI can help you identify solutions for your known unknowns, curate learning routines, and even offer alternatives to complex explanations. Gone are the days when tasks required two or more individuals - with AI, you can take a head start as a one-person army. 

[Magick ML](https://magickml.com/) can be your AI co-founder, ready to step into action. It can handle feature requests, manage your backlog, orchestrate your scrum ceremonies, and even assist in creating a roadmap or initiating OKRs. It can generate the basic code you need to kickstart your journey and assuage the loneliness that often accompanies the entrepreneurial journey. At present, we are unleashing the potential of experienced Engineers, and we gradually improve our product to unlock new capabilities for other builders. 

So embrace the future, harness the potential of AI, and step into your role as a visionary, equipped with the tools to build the future. Because you're not alone on this journey. With your AI co-founder, the future you envision isn't just a distant reality, but a tangible goal within reach.
