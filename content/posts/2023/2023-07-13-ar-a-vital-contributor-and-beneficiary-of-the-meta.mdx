In the swiftly evolving landscape of the digital world, terms such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality (MR), and Extended Reality (XR) often rise and fall. For those who might benefit from a brief overview, let's demystify these terms:

- **AR**, or Augmented Reality, superimposes computer-generated images onto the user's real-world view, offering a merged perspective.

- **VR**, or Virtual Reality, delivers simulated experiences that can either mirror or vastly differ from our reality.

- **MR**, or Mixed Reality, intertwines physical and digital worlds, fostering interactions between physical and virtual objects.

- **XR**, or Extended Reality, is a comprehensive term capturing AR, VR, and MR, as well as future reality technologies.

Meanwhile, the **Metaverse** signifies the cumulative sum of all digital entities, encompassing everything from AR, VR, Blockchain, and digital files (like PDFs), to Websites, Apps, Games, digital photos, and music files. *We continuously contribute to and draw from this digital reservoir we call &#8220;the Metaverse&#8221;*.

AR plays a key role in extending the Metaverse into our physical realm, offering an alternative means for us to interact with digital content and each other. For instance, imagine leaving a love note for your spouse outside their office. Their AR-enabled phone or glasses could bring your message to life at any time, adding a unique dimension to their day.

Moreover, AR and MR can metamorphose your living room into a concert hall. Imagine soaking in a James Brown performance with your family, facilitated by various AR devices. The genesis of such innovation lies in AR's inherent openness and accessibility.

See it is not &#8220;AR vs. VR&#8221;. Nor is it &#8220;the &#8216;[Real World Metaverse](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/niantic-reveals-its-vision-for-a-real-world-metaverse-releases-lightship-ar-developer-kit/)&#8217; vs. the Metaverse,&#8221; um&#8230; no. We are not at war here, we are supposed to be on the same team! 

![prompt: experimental HUD with geometric instruments on the display from the inside of Iron Mans suit, first person perspective, highly detailed](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KtvF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1183ed3-d5bf-4eb7-9e7c-d6d758032820_1024x1024.png)

This brings us to a critical aspect: open standards. Constructing an AR experience on a specific platform, say Instagram, traps it within that platform's ecosystem. In contrast, open protocols like WebXR democratize the experience, enabling access across any device and breaking down the barriers of platform exclusivity.

AR's reach extends to empowering entrepreneurs, too. For instance, it facilitates the launch of fashion brands without the need for physical stores. Customers can virtually try on clothes and verify their fit before making a purchase.

As we witness continuous advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, we're inching closer to having [AI extensions of ourselves](https://mrmetaverse.substack.com/p/the-augmented-founder?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2). These could manifest as [virtual companions, accessible and interactive via any screen](https://mrmetaverse.substack.com/p/project-pearl-and-your-ai-companion?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2).

AR can also amplify tourism experiences. Tourists can navigate cities while interacting with and collecting hidden digital treasures, offering an unprecedented exploratory experience.

Virtual property is another burgeoning concept, with companies creating digital twins of Earth and selling geofenced parts of it. App users can interact with and view content placed by these virtual parcel owners.

Recognizing the need for interoperability in the digital realm, a diverse group of early contributors founded the [Open Metaverse Interoperability Group](https://omigroup.org/) (OMI). Our mission is to co-create protocols for VR, AR, and the web, enabling the seamless migration of assets and avatars across various platforms in the Metaverse.

**There is tremendous potential for profitability in interoperability.** The ability to utilize assets across platforms greatly enhances personal experiences. Users can maintain a consistent avatar identity across the Metaverse, introducing a level of authenticity to digital interactions. In fact, many users report feeling more themselves when interacting as their avatar than in the real world.

The thrill of asset interoperability expands further in AR. Imagine discovering a rare artifact during a city exploration in AR and then being able to utilize the same in a VR game. Such seamless transferability is made possible through open standards.

Looking forward, I see the emergence of a [new class of entrepreneurs who leverage interoperability](https://mrmetaverse.substack.com/p/the-augmented-founder?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2) even within walled gardens like Apple's ecosystem. Backed by WebXR and open file formats, these pioneers can initiate ventures that intricately weave together virtual and physical worlds, fueling the continuous expansion of the Metaverse.
