A lot has been happening in my life over the past few months. Truth be told, I've been tired&#8212;deeply, profoundly tired. For those who have ventured into the world of entrepreneurship, you'll recognize this sort of exhaustion. Juggling the demands of a start-up and still bootstrapping through consulting engagements. I do this with pride because, well, I'm pretty damn good at it.

But this commitment often comes at a cost. Moments when I should be engaging with you through videos, writing, or creative content, I often find myself thinking, "Shouldn&#8217;t I be dedicating this time to [Magick](https://magickml.com/)? I've missed giving love to Angell XR, a project close to my heart for over a decade. It feels both like I'm flying at 500mph and hovering, keeping everything at a holding pattern, as we relentlessly work towards launching and refining our product. Maybe I am on a Ferris Wheel.

However, amidst this whirlwind, there's so much I'm proud of. I get to marry my best friend in 4 months. Magick got the spotlight at Google I/O earlier this spring. The collaboration with the Google team has been nothing short of inspiring. The key partnerships we've forged and the love we've received from early adopters fills me with gratitude. These are folks who are not just enamoured with what our product can do, but also have a keen interest in seeing us evolve and improve. Despite not writing, my life is so very good. 

Self-care has still been a constant. My routine includes yoga, running, hiking, and swimming about 4-5 times a week. Sleep, once a luxury, is now a priority; I'm clocking in 7-8 rejuvenating hours nightly. Every step, every challenge, is a stride closer to the finish line. Health is wealth baby. I don&#8217;t subscribe to the &#8220;work yourself to death and tweet about it&#8221; mantra. It&#8217;s toxic, and unhealthy. Don&#8217;t die trying to make other people rich. 

I want to reconnect with you all, my community. Writing, video production, sharing those forgotten stories &#8211; like my involvement in DC Startup Week panels, the 6G conference in DC, and the AI discussions we spearheaded at AACC. DC is alive with opportunities in AI innovation, and it's exhilarating to be in it, rather than on the sidelines.

To each of you out there, knee-deep in your projects and aspirations: Keep pushing. Keep building. And know that, through the highs and lows, the journey is what matters the most. Stay inspired, keep learning, and deliver on your promises. 

Until next time, please consider subscribing to my little blog. And if you want to chat with live AI agents that are actually *useful* please check out [magickml.com](https://magickml.com/) - we recently onboarded every member of the waitlist, so you can access the platform now!
