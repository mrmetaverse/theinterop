In a recent article titled "[RIP Metaverse](https://www.businessinsider.com/metaverse-dead-obituary-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-tech-fad-ai-chatgpt-2023-5?op=1)," Ed Zitron's interpretation of the Metaverse as a "newborn concept" showcases a misunderstanding of this digital universe's theoretical and historical context. It is essential to correct such an oversight, particularly when published on a platform of such reach and influence.

## **The Metaverse Misunderstood**

Ed Zitron's critique centers around an incomplete account of the Metaverse definition. His contention with the current state of the Metaverse fails to acknowledge the broader scope and inherent nature of this digital parallel to our physical universe. It's far more than low-quality VR avatars or flashy promotional videos.

## **A Refresher**

The concept of the Metaverse has been with us in theory for decades, if not longer. It encompasses all digital interactions, from mundane activities like email and PDFs to more immersive experiences like gaming, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR). A more comprehensive understanding of the Metaverse includes these facets and more.

## **A Brief Timeline of the Metaverse**
To further underline this point, let's trace the Metaverse's roots:

**1976**: The creation of xModem, a binary transfer protocol by Ward Christensen, marks the Metaverse's nascent stage as it enables digital file transfers.

**1992**: In his book Snow Crash, [Neil Stephenson](https://nealstephenson.com/) coins the term "Metaverse," linking the digital universe with all things virtual.

**March 2021**: The [Open Metaverse Interoperability (OMI) group](https://omigroup.org/) forms, establishing protocols for open interoperability and championing standards like WebXR, preempting the Metaverse land-grab by companies like Facebook and Apple.

**October 2021**: [Facebook transitions to Meta](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59083601), publicly committing to "building the Metaverse." This announcement triggers an explosion of commentary and speculation about the Metaverse's future.

**2021 and 2022**: The concept of the Metaverse becomes a buzzword, with companies staking their claim on their own versions of the digital universe.

**2023**: Apple unveils [xrOS](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/12/01/apple-ar-vr-operating-system-now-called-xros) but shies away from using the term Metaverse, showcasing a proprietary approach to digital integration.

## **The Metaverse: Not Owned, But Shared**

One thing must be clear: the Metaverse, by definition, cannot be owned. It represents a collective digital space that all users, creators, and companies share and contribute to. The concept has existed for decades and will continue to evolve, driven by technological advancements and the creative ways we choose to interact in this digital universe.

Ed Zitron's analysis is reductive and misses the complex history and broader implications of the Metaverse. We must remember that the Metaverse isn't a mere fad or corporate race&#8212;it's an integral part of our digital evolution. It&#8217;s not Metaverse OR Blockchain OR AI. It&#8217;s not VR OR AR. It&#8217;s all of that baby, and it&#8217;s not going anywhere.

## **In Conclusion**

The assertion that the Metaverse has failed is a misinterpretation. The opposition Facebook encountered was less about the Metaverse's viability and more about a rejection of Facebook's presumed monopoly over it. Facebook may have given the illusion they were single-handedly creating the Metaverse, misleading many. However, the real story is not that the Metaverse failed, but that Facebook failed to monopolize it &#8212; a clear victory for the open, interconnected digital universe that the Metaverse represents.
