The life of a designer is about as lavish as you make it. The beauty of being a designer is that every day is different. You get to apply your mind, body, and spirit into your work. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, and you’ll conquer obstacles.

### This particular type of roller-coaster does require maintenance.

**You have to read**. There is a wealth of knowledge online and in person. But sometimes, it’s nice to take a break from screen time, and absorb your information from a real book. A paper one, that you can feel with your hands. I highly recommend a little sniff as well, new books smell amazing.

**You have to explore**. Make mistakes! Test out new software. Try a [new color palette](https://coolors.co/). Solicit feedback — it will help you grow.

**Embrace competition**. It’s not about competition. You can learn so much from the designs of others. If you can keep your ego in check, you’ll get a lot further.

**You can benefit immensely from community**. Sharing the joys, and the pain of being a designer make you better. If you can attend a local meetup, or tap into [a good reddit board](https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/), you gain instant access to this type of therapy. But sometimes as designers, *we get busy*. That’s why I love podcasts.

### **So why am I writing this?**

Recently, [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) released an article, “Our 15 favorite design podcasts.” They named a few really great podcasts to check out, like [The Design of Business | The Business of Design,](https://designobserver.com/designofbusiness) and [Design Matters](https://www.designmattersmedia.com/designmatters) (Debbie Millman). However, my team and I feel like they really missed some mission-critical, *drop everything you’re doing and crank of up the volume* podcasts that are available.

So we made a list of our own. Here are the top 6 podcasts for design.

**1. Product Breakfast Club** — “The Product Breakfast Club Podcast is the perfect podcast for those looking for a behind-the-scenes look at how products are designed, how product teams work and for those wondering how to make better products faster.”

**4. Sprint** — It’s not a podcast, but you should read it. Or if you really do prefer to listen to content, ask a friend to read it to you as you work. I’m sure they won’t mind.

That’s it! That is the definitive list — the end-all-be-all solution to your design community needs. You’ll laugh. You’ll cry. You’ll grow as a person, and you’ll waste a lot of time. Everything you need, in one action-packed podcast.

This is obviously satire meant to heal the wounds of our dear friends at Product Breakfast Club. Jake, and Jonathan, please don’t stop doing what you do. Cheers.
