# Peake.ai: We Built Our Own AI Phone System in 1 Hour

*When the solution does not exist, you build it yourself.*

## The Problem

We were sick of it.

Every VoIP provider we tried had the same issues:

- **Overpriced** for what you actually get
- **Clunky configurations** that required a PhD to set up
- **No AI integration** without expensive add-ons
- **Desktop apps** we did not want to install
- **Per-seat pricing** that punished growing teams

Our outbound team needed to make calls. They needed contact information. They needed it to be simple. Every existing solution failed at least one of these requirements.

## The Decision

On a Friday afternoon, frustrated after another hour wrestling with VoIP configurations, we made a decision: **we would build our own.**

Not a prototype. Not a demo. A real, working phone system.

## V1: Live in 60 Minutes

Using AI-assisted development, we shipped V1 in exactly one hour:

**What V1 Included:**

- Browser-based calling (no apps to install)
- Inbound and outbound calls
- Basic call logging
- Works from any device with a browser

**The Stack:**

- Next.js for the frontend
- Twilio for telephony backbone
- Vercel for deployment
- Cursor for AI-assisted development

By 5:30 PM on that Friday, we were making real calls from a browser. No installs. No configurations. Just a URL.

## Hour 2: LangChain Automations

We did not stop at basic calling. Within another hour, we had LangChain-powered automations running:

### AI Contact Discovery

Paste any website URL. The AI scrapes and analyzes the page, finding:

- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Contact forms
- Key personnel

No more manual research. No more copy-pasting from LinkedIn. Paste a URL, get contact info.

### Call Context Preparation

Before each call, the AI:

- Pulls relevant company information
- Summarizes recent interactions
- Suggests talking points
- Identifies potential pain points based on industry

### Real-Time Assistance

During calls:

- Quick lookups without leaving the call screen
- Note-taking assistance
- Follow-up task creation
- CRM updates (when integrated)

## The Philosophy: Humans Lead, AI Empowers

**This is not a robot calling people.**

Peake.ai is a tool for real humans making real calls. The AI handles the tedious parts:

- Finding contact information
- Preparing call context
- Taking notes
- Managing follow-ups

The human handles what humans do best:

- Building relationships
- Understanding nuance
- Closing deals
- Being authentic

We believe outbound calling should be done by people who care about the conversation. AI should remove friction, not replace connection.

## Features Today

What started as a frustrated Friday afternoon project is now a production system:

### Browser-Based Calling

Make and receive calls directly from your browser. Works on desktop, laptop, or tablet. No apps to install, no softphones to configure.

### SMS & MMS Messaging

Full text messaging with conversation history. Send media files. Manage all customer communications in one place.

### AI Contact Discovery

Paste any URL. Get contact information. It is that simple. The AI finds emails, phone numbers, and key personnel from any website.

### Call Recording

One-click recording after consent. Dual-channel audio for clear playback. Full history accessible anytime.

### Contact Management

Import contacts from CSV, TXT, or Markdown. Bulk upload hundreds of contacts. Organize with tags and notes.

### Call Logs & History

Complete call history with duration, status, and recordings. Export to CSV for reporting. Never lose track of a conversation.

## Technical Implementation

**Frontend:**

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Real-time WebRTC for calls
- Progressive Web App capable

**AI Layer:**

- LangChain for orchestration
- OpenAI for language understanding
- Custom scrapers for contact discovery
- Structured output parsing for reliability

**Telephony:**

- Twilio for SIP trunking
- WebRTC for browser audio
- STUN/TURN for NAT traversal
- Dual-channel recording

**Infrastructure:**

- Vercel for frontend hosting
- Edge functions for low latency
- Secure WebSocket connections
- End-to-end encryption

## Results

### For Virgent AI

- **2 hours** from idea to production
- **Daily use** by our outbound team
- **Significant cost reduction** vs. enterprise VoIP
- **AI integration** that actually works

### For Our Clients

- **Simple onboarding** - just a URL
- **No per-seat surprises** - straightforward pricing
- **AI that helps** - not AI theater
- **Modern UX** - feels like 2025, not 2005

## Why We Are Sharing This

This case study exists for two reasons:

1. **Proof of capability.** When we say we can build AI-enhanced tools quickly, this is what we mean. Not mockups. Not demos. Production systems that we use ourselves.

2. **A product you can use.** Peake.ai is available. If you need a modern phone system with AI baked in, we built it because we needed it. Maybe you need it too.

## The Lesson

Sometimes the best solution is the one you build yourself.

We spent months evaluating VoIP providers, comparing feature matrices, negotiating contracts. The answer was not in any of those spreadsheets.

The answer was: **stop fussing with clunky configs and just code it.**

Two hours later, we had exactly what we needed. No compromises. No unnecessary features. No enterprise pricing.
