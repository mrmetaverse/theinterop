# Peake.ai: We Built Our Own AI Phone System in 1 Hour

**Industry:** AI Communications

## The Challenge

Like many small businesses, we were paying too much for VoIP services that didn't fit our needs. The existing solutions were either too expensive, too complex, or lacked the AI integrations we wanted for our outbound sales workflow.

## Our Approach

Instead of settling for off-the-shelf solutions, we decided to build our own AI-enhanced phone system. The goal was simple: create a working system in under 2 hours that we could iterate on.

### Key Features Built

- **Voice AI Integration**: Connected our phone system to our LangChain workflow
- **Automatic Call Transcription**: Every call is transcribed and summarized
- **Smart Routing**: AI-powered routing based on caller intent
- **CRM Integration**: Automatic logging of all call data

## Results

- **V1 live in 60 minutes** - Basic phone system operational
- **LangChain automations in 2 hours** - Full AI workflow connected
- **$500+/month savings** - Compared to enterprise VoIP solutions
- **Powers all outbound calling** - Now our primary communication system

## Technical Stack

- Twilio for telephony backbone
- LangChain for AI orchestration
- Custom Next.js dashboard
- PostgreSQL for call logging

## Key Takeaways

1. **Build what you need** - Sometimes the best solution is the one you build yourself
2. **Start simple** - V1 doesn't need every feature
3. **Iterate fast** - We add new features weekly based on actual usage
4. **AI integration from day one** - Building AI-native beats retrofitting
