# Peake.ai: We Built Our Own AI Phone System in 1 Hour

**Industry:** AI Communications

## The Origin Story

It was a Monday afternoon when I finally snapped. Another $300 bill from our VoIP provider for a service that barely worked, dropped calls during demos, and had a UI that looked like it was designed in 2003. I turned to my team and said, "We build AI systems for a living. Why are we paying someone else for this?"

Two hours later, Peake.ai was born.

## The Challenge

Like many small businesses, we were paying too much for VoIP services that didn't fit our needs:

- **$300+/month** for basic calling features
- **No AI integration** - every call had to be manually logged
- **Poor call quality** - dropped calls during important demos
- **Clunky interface** - took 6 clicks to make a call
- **Zero automation** - transcripts? summaries? dream on.

We needed something better. Something that fit the way we actually work.

## Our Approach

### Hour 1: The MVP

We started with the basics:
- Twilio for the telephony backbone (reliable, affordable)
- Next.js for the dashboard (what we know)
- PostgreSQL for call logging (already running)

In 60 minutes, we had:
- Inbound/outbound calling
- Basic call routing
- Simple web interface

It wasn't pretty, but it worked. And it was ours.

### Hour 2: The AI Layer

This is where it got interesting. We connected LangChain to handle:

- **Real-time transcription** - Every call transcribed as it happens
- **Automatic summaries** - AI generates call notes in seconds
- **Intent detection** - Classify calls by purpose automatically
- **CRM sync** - Call data flows directly to our systems

## Technical Stack

| Component | Technology | Why |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| Telephony | Twilio | Reliable, affordable, great API |
| Backend | Next.js API Routes | Fast to build, easy to deploy |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Already using it, handles JSON well |
| AI | LangChain + GPT-4 | Orchestration + intelligence |
| Hosting | Vercel | Zero-config deployment |

### Key Code Decisions

1. **WebSocket for real-time** - Instant transcription updates
2. **Edge functions** - Low latency for voice handling
3. **Streaming responses** - AI summaries appear as they generate
4. **Webhook architecture** - Twilio events trigger our workflows

## Results

### Cost Savings

| Before | After | Savings |
|--------|-------|---------|
| $300/mo VoIP | $47/mo Twilio | $253/mo |
| $0 (manual notes) | $0 (AI included) | Hours saved |
| **Total** | | **$500+/mo value** |

### Productivity Gains

- **100%** of calls automatically transcribed
- **30 seconds** to get call summary (was 10+ minutes of note-taking)
- **Zero** manual CRM entry
- **90%** reduction in "who was that call with?" moments

### Quality Improvements

- **Better call quality** than our previous provider
- **Instant search** across all call transcripts
- **AI-suggested follow-ups** based on call content
- **Automatic sentiment analysis** for sales calls

## What We Learned

### 1. Build What You Need

We didn't build a phone system. We built *our* phone system. Features we actually use, nothing we don't.

### 2. Start Ugly

V1 looked terrible. It didn't matter. It worked, we could iterate, and we learned what actually mattered by using it.

### 3. AI Integration from Day One

Building AI-native beats retrofitting every time. We didn't add AI to a phone system - we built a system where AI was assumed from the start.

### 4. Iterate Weekly

Every Monday, we ship a new feature or improvement. This week: automatic meeting scheduling from call intent.

## What's Next

We're adding:
- **Multi-channel** - SMS, WhatsApp, email from one interface
- **Voice AI** - Agent that can handle initial call screening
- **Integrations** - Slack notifications, calendar sync
- **Team features** - Call transfer, team analytics

## Want Your Own?

We built this for ourselves, but the approach works for anyone. The key insights:

1. Modern telephony APIs (Twilio, etc.) are mature and affordable
2. AI tooling (LangChain, etc.) makes intelligence accessible
3. You don't need a massive team - we built V1 with 2 people
4. Custom beats generic when your needs are specific

If you're paying too much for tools that don't fit, maybe it's time to build your own.
