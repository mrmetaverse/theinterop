# DJ Audio Stems Automation Agent

**Industry:** Entertainment & Music

## The Problem

Professional DJs spend countless hours managing their music libraries. One particular pain point: finding and organizing audio stems (isolated tracks—drums, bass, vocals, etc.) for remix and mashup work.

A professional DJ client was spending 10+ hours per week on this task alone.

## The Solution

We built a conversational AI agent that:

1. **Discovers stems** - Searches multiple sources for available stems
2. **Organizes files** - Auto-categorizes and tags discovered content
3. **Suggests combinations** - Recommends compatible stems for mixing
4. **Maintains library** - Keeps everything organized and searchable

## Technical Implementation

### Conversation Flow

```
DJ: "Find stems for 'Blinding Lights' by The Weeknd"

Agent: "Found 3 stem packs for 'Blinding Lights':
        1. Official DJ pack (vocals, drums, bass, synths)
        2. Community separation (AI-extracted)
        3. Bootleg stems (drums only)
        
        Want me to download and organize any of these?"

DJ: "Get the official pack and file it for 80s-style mixes"

Agent: "Done! Filed under /Library/80s-Style/Blinding-Lights/
        Tagged: synthwave, 80s, vocals-clean, The Weeknd
        Added to 'Recent Acquisitions' smart playlist"
```

### Core Capabilities

- **Multi-source search** - Beatport, Loopcloud, community databases
- **Audio analysis** - Automatically detects BPM, key, genre
- **Smart filing** - Rules-based organization with learning
- **License tracking** - Logs source and usage rights

### Integration Points

- DJ software (Serato, Rekordbox)
- Cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive)
- Metadata services (MusicBrainz, Discogs)

## Results

### Time Savings

| Task | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Stem discovery | 30 min/track | 2 min |
| Organization | 10 min/track | Automatic |
| Library maintenance | 5 hrs/week | 30 min/week |
| **Total weekly savings** | | **8+ hours** |

### Quality Improvements

- More consistent file organization
- Better metadata accuracy
- Easier to find specific stems mid-set
- Comprehensive license documentation

## Broader Applications

This pattern applies beyond DJs:

- **Video editors** - B-roll and asset discovery
- **Podcast producers** - Sound effect and music libraries
- **Designers** - Asset management and organization
- **Researchers** - Literature and data organization

The core insight: AI agents excel at tedious, repetitive information work that follows patterns but requires judgment.

## Key Learnings

1. **Domain expertise matters** - Understanding DJ workflows was critical
2. **Conversational UX works** - Natural language beats complex GUIs for discovery
3. **Integration is key** - Value comes from connecting to existing tools
4. **Start narrow** - Master one use case before expanding
