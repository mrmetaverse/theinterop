# Stopping Fake Leads with Agentic Validation on Our Website

**Industry:** AI Consulting

## The Spam Problem

Like many B2B companies, we were drowning in fake contact form submissions. Bots, spam, and low-quality leads were clogging our pipeline and wasting sales time.

Traditional solutions (CAPTCHAs, honeypots) weren't enough. We needed something smarter.

## Our Agentic Solution

We built an AI agent that evaluates every contact form submission in real-time:

### What It Checks

1. **Content coherence** - Does the message make sense?
2. **Business context** - Does this look like a real business inquiry?
3. **Behavioral signals** - How was the form filled out?
4. **Cross-reference data** - Does the email/company exist?

### Explainable Decisions

Every decision comes with reasoning:

```
PASS: "Legitimate inquiry from verified company domain. 
      Message shows clear business need. 
      Form completion pattern matches human behavior."

BLOCK: "Message contains gibberish text. 
       Email domain is known spam source. 
       Form completed in 0.3 seconds (bot-like)."
```

## Implementation Details

### The Flow

1. User submits form
2. Agent evaluates (50-200ms)
3. Pass → Goes to CRM
4. Uncertain → Goes to review queue
5. Block → Soft rejection with alternative contact

### Technical Stack

- LangChain for agent logic
- Vercel Edge Functions for speed
- Custom scoring model
- Logging for continuous improvement

## Results

### Before Agentic Validation

- 70% of submissions were spam/low-quality
- Sales spent 2+ hours/day qualifying leads
- Legitimate prospects sometimes lost in noise

### After Implementation

- **95% spam blocked** at form submission
- **Zero false positives** on real business inquiries
- Sales time reclaimed for actual selling
- Better prospect experience (faster response)

## Key Learnings

1. **Explainability matters** - We can review why any decision was made
2. **Soft rejections work** - Don't just block, offer alternatives
3. **Continuous improvement** - Agent gets smarter with feedback
4. **Speed is critical** - 200ms budget for great UX
