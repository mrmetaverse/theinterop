# Non-Profit AI Education Workshops

**Industry:** Non-Profit Education

## The "We Ask AI to Do Things" Workshop Series

AI education shouldn't be limited to tech companies and well-funded enterprises. We partnered with several non-profits to deliver our signature workshop series to underserved communities.

## Workshop Design

### Core Philosophy

- **Hands-on first** - Learn by doing, not by slides
- **Practical focus** - Real tasks, real tools, real results
- **Accessible language** - No jargon, no prerequisites
- **Safe exploration** - Encourage experimentation without fear

### Session Structure

Each 2-hour workshop follows this format:

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 0-15 min | Context setting, demo of what's possible |
| 15-45 min | Guided hands-on exercise #1 |
| 45-60 min | Discussion and Q&A |
| 60-90 min | Hands-on exercise #2 (more advanced) |
| 90-120 min | Personal application planning |

## Audiences Served

### High School Students (STEM Program)

**Context:** After-school program for students interested in technology careers

**Customization:**
- Used examples relevant to school/social life
- Emphasized AI ethics and responsibility
- Connected to career pathways

**Outcome:** 92% reported increased interest in AI careers

### Small Business Owners (Chamber of Commerce)

**Context:** Local chamber's professional development series

**Customization:**
- Focused on immediate business applications
- Marketing, customer service, operations examples
- Tools they could use tomorrow

**Outcome:** 85% implemented at least one AI tool within 30 days

### Non-Profit Staff (Workforce Development)

**Context:** Organizations serving job seekers and career changers

**Customization:**
- AI for job search and skill development
- Resume optimization, interview prep
- Understanding AI in hiring processes

**Outcome:** Participants reported 40% faster job search progress

## Key Learnings

### What Works

1. **Immediate utility** - People engage when they see instant value
2. **Hands-on time** - More doing, less talking
3. **Peer learning** - Group exercises create community
4. **Take-home resources** - Guides, prompts, tool lists

### What Doesn't Work

1. **Technical deep dives** - Save for advanced sessions
2. **Fear-based framing** - "AI will take your job" discourages learning
3. **Tool-specific training** - Focus on concepts, not specific products
4. **Passive consumption** - Lectures don't create competence

## Impact Metrics

Across all workshop series:

- **500+ participants** educated
- **87% satisfaction** rating
- **73% tool adoption** within 60 days
- **50+ hours** of curriculum developed

## Scaling the Model

We're now working to:

1. **Train facilitators** - Enable partner orgs to deliver workshops
2. **Create curriculum packages** - Self-guided versions for broader reach
3. **Build community** - Connect workshop alumni for ongoing learning
4. **Measure long-term impact** - Track career and business outcomes

## Partnership Opportunities

Non-profits interested in bringing AI education to their communities can:

1. Host a workshop (we facilitate)
2. License curriculum (train-the-trainer)
3. Co-develop custom content
4. Join our education network

AI literacy is becoming essential. We're committed to ensuring it's accessible to everyone.
