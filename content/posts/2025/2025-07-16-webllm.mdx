# Create And Power Your Own Models. WebLLM.

**Industry:** Enterprise AI Strategy

## The Privacy Imperative

Enterprise AI adoption has a fundamental tension: to get value from AI, you often need to send sensitive data to external APIs. For many industries—healthcare, finance, legal, government—this is a non-starter.

WebLLM changes this equation entirely.

## What is WebLLM?

WebLLM runs large language models directly in the browser using WebGPU. No data leaves the user's device. Ever.

### Key Capabilities

- **100% client-side inference** - Data never touches a server
- **GPU-accelerated** - Near-native performance
- **No API costs** - Run unlimited queries
- **Offline capable** - Works without internet

## Enterprise Use Cases

### 1. Sensitive Document Analysis

Legal teams can analyze contracts without exposing client data:
- Upload document → Model runs locally → Insights generated
- Zero data transmission
- Full audit compliance

### 2. Healthcare Applications

Patient data stays on the device:
- Symptom analysis
- Record summarization
- Clinical decision support

### 3. Financial Services

Trading desks and analysts can process proprietary information:
- Market analysis on sensitive data
- Compliance checking
- Client communication drafting

## Technical Implementation

### Model Options

We typically deploy:
- Llama variants (7B-13B)
- Mistral
- Custom fine-tuned models

### Performance Characteristics

| Device | Model Size | Tokens/Second |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| M2 Mac | 7B | 20-30 |
| RTX 4080 | 13B | 40-50 |
| iPhone 15 | 3B | 10-15 |

### Hybrid Architecture

We often combine WebLLM with cloud APIs:
- WebLLM for sensitive data processing
- Cloud APIs for non-sensitive, complex tasks
- Smart routing based on data classification

## Deployment Approach

### Phase 1: Assessment
- Data sensitivity mapping
- Hardware inventory
- Use case prioritization

### Phase 2: Pilot
- Deploy WebLLM for single use case
- Measure performance and adoption
- Gather feedback

### Phase 3: Scale
- Expand to additional use cases
- Optimize model selection
- Build internal expertise

## Why This Matters

The companies deploying WebLLM today will have:
- **Competitive advantage** in privacy-sensitive markets
- **Lower long-term costs** (no per-query API fees)
- **True data sovereignty**

The technology is production-ready. The question is whether you'll adopt it before or after your competitors.
