# How We Saved a Customer More Than Our Cost in the First Month

**Industry:** Financial Publishing

## The Situation

A financial publishing company came to us frustrated. They had spent six figures on a chatbot solution that was actively making things worse. Customer satisfaction was dropping, support tickets were piling up, and their "automation" was creating more work, not less.

Their existing chatbot:
- **Bounced 70%** of users back to human agents
- **Increased ticket volume** by confusing customers
- **Damaged brand perception** with unhelpful responses
- **Cost $15,000/month** in licensing fees

They were ready to give up on AI entirely.

## Our Approach

We proposed something different: a production AI agent built on modern tooling, deployed in 2 weeks, with measurable ROI targets.

### Week 1: Discovery & Architecture

We spent the first week understanding their actual needs:
- Analyzed 10,000 support tickets for common patterns
- Mapped their knowledge base (scattered across 5 systems)
- Identified the 20% of queries that caused 80% of tickets
- Designed an architecture that could handle their volume

### Week 2: Build & Deploy

With clear requirements, we built fast:
- **LangChain** for orchestration and memory
- **RAG** connected to their unified knowledge base
- **Intent recognition** for smart routing
- **WebLLM** for privacy-sensitive operations
- **Human handoff** that preserved context

## Technical Implementation

### The AI Stack

```
User Query → Intent Classification → Router
                                      ↓
                              ┌───────┴───────┐
                              ↓               ↓
                         RAG Agent      Human Handoff
                              ↓               ↓
                        Knowledge Base    Support Team
                              ↓               
                      Response Generation    
                              ↓
                        Quality Check
                              ↓
                           User
```

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Hybrid RAG**: Combined semantic search with keyword matching for financial terms
2. **Confidence scoring**: AI only responds when confident, otherwise escalates
3. **Context preservation**: Full conversation history passed to human agents
4. **Continuous learning**: Feedback loop from agent ratings improves responses

## Results

### Month 1 Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Tickets/day | 450 | 225 | -50% |
| First response | 4 hours | 4 seconds | -99.97% |
| Resolution rate | 30% | 82% | +173% |
| CSAT score | 3.2/5 | 4.4/5 | +37% |
| Monthly cost | $15,000 | $4,800 | -68% |

### Savings Breakdown

- **Support labor**: $6,500/month saved (50% ticket reduction)
- **Software licensing**: $10,200/month saved (replaced old chatbot)
- **Customer retention**: Immeasurable (CSAT up 37%)

**Total first-month savings: $16,700**
**Our fee: $12,000**
**Net ROI: $4,700 profit in month 1**

## What Made the Difference

### 1. RAG Over Fine-Tuning

Their old solution tried to fine-tune a model on their content. This:
- Took 3 months to set up
- Required constant retraining as content changed
- Still hallucinated when asked about new products

Our RAG approach:
- Deployed in 2 weeks
- Updates instantly when content changes
- Cites sources for every answer

### 2. Smart Escalation

The old chatbot would either answer (often wrong) or give up. Our agent:
- Knows when it doesn't know
- Escalates with full context
- Learns from human resolutions

### 3. Intent-Based Routing

Not every query needs AI. We built routing for:
- **Quick lookups**: Price, hours, contact info → instant response
- **Complex questions**: Product comparisons, account issues → RAG agent
- **Sensitive matters**: Complaints, cancellations → human priority queue

## Client Testimonial

> "We were ready to abandon AI entirely. Virgent showed us what was possible when you build for the actual problem instead of the hype. ROI in 30 days changed how our board views AI investment."
> 
> — VP of Customer Experience

## Lessons Learned

1. **Measure before building** - Clear baselines made ROI undeniable
2. **Start narrow** - We solved 5 query types perfectly before expanding
3. **Humans in the loop** - AI + human beats AI alone every time
4. **Speed builds trust** - 2-week delivery earned us ongoing work

## What Happened Next

After month 1 success, we:
- Expanded to 3 more query categories
- Added proactive outreach for at-risk accounts
- Built internal tools for support team
- Now managing their entire AI strategy
