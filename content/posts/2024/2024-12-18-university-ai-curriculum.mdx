# University AI Curriculum Development

**Industry:** Higher Education

## The Challenge

A leading art university approached us to develop AI curriculum for their MFA program. The challenge: introduce students to AI tools that are transforming creative fields, while addressing legitimate concerns about ethics, authenticity, and artistic integrity.

## Curriculum Design

### Learning Objectives

By the end of the series, students should be able to:

1. Understand how AI tools work at a conceptual level
2. Use AI as a creative collaborator, not replacement
3. Navigate ethical considerations in AI-assisted art
4. Critically evaluate AI's role in creative industries

### Four-Part Structure

#### Lecture 1: AI Foundations for Artists

**Topics:**
- What is AI? Demystifying the technology
- How generative AI models work (conceptual)
- Current capabilities and limitations
- AI in art history: from AARON to DALL-E

**Hands-on:** Generate images with different prompting strategies

#### Lecture 2: AI as Creative Collaborator

**Topics:**
- Human-AI collaboration models
- Ideation and iteration with AI
- Maintaining artistic voice with AI assistance
- Case studies: artists using AI effectively

**Hands-on:** Collaborative creation session—human + AI working together

#### Lecture 3: Ethics, Authenticity, and Attribution

**Topics:**
- Training data and consent issues
- Copyright and ownership questions
- Disclosure and transparency practices
- Developing personal ethical frameworks

**Hands-on:** Ethics scenario discussions and policy drafting

#### Lecture 4: AI in Your Practice

**Topics:**
- Tool landscape and selection criteria
- Workflow integration strategies
- Future trends and implications
- Building a sustainable AI practice

**Hands-on:** Personal practice planning and peer feedback

## Key Pedagogical Decisions

### Why These Topics?

Art students have specific concerns:
- Will AI replace artists?
- Is AI-assisted work "real" art?
- How do I talk about AI in my practice?
- What are the legal implications?

We addressed these directly rather than avoiding them.

### Hands-On Focus

Each lecture includes substantial practical work because:
- Abstract discussions only go so far
- Direct experience builds informed opinions
- Students need to develop their own workflows

### Safe Exploration Space

We created an environment where:
- No question was too basic or too critical
- Experimentation was encouraged
- Different viewpoints were respected
- Personal boundaries were honored

## Delivery Format

- **Duration:** 4 sessions × 3 hours = 12 total hours
- **Class size:** 20-25 students
- **Format:** Lecture + discussion + hands-on
- **Materials:** Slides, tool access, reading list, prompt library

## Student Feedback

### Quantitative

- **4.7/5** overall satisfaction
- **92%** said content was relevant to their practice
- **88%** felt more confident using AI tools
- **95%** would recommend to peers

### Qualitative Themes

> "Finally, an AI course that takes artistic concerns seriously."

> "I went from scared of AI to excited about possibilities."

> "The ethics discussion was the most valuable part."

> "I now have a clear framework for how I want to use these tools."

## Curriculum Adaptations

This curriculum has been adapted for:

- **Design programs** - More focus on commercial applications
- **Writing programs** - Emphasis on text generation ethics
- **Music programs** - Audio AI tools and copyright issues
- **General education** - Broader, less practice-specific

## Availability
