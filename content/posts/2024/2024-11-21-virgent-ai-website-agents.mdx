# How We Built Our Own Website with Agentic Design

**Industry:** AI Consulting

## Dogfooding Our Own Approach

At Virgent AI, we believe in practicing what we preach. Our website isn't just a marketing site—it's a working demonstration of agentic design principles.

## What is Agentic Design?

Agentic design treats every touchpoint as an opportunity for intelligent interaction. Instead of static pages, we build systems that:

- **Respond to context** - Adapt based on user behavior
- **Anticipate needs** - Proactively offer relevant information
- **Learn and improve** - Get smarter with each interaction
- **Scale human effort** - Handle routine tasks automatically

## Our Website Implementation

### 1. Intelligent Contact Form

As detailed in our other case study, our contact form uses AI to:
- Filter spam and low-quality submissions
- Assess lead quality in real-time
- Provide instant, personalized responses
- Route to appropriate follow-up flows

### 2. Embedded Prompts

Throughout the site, we use embedded prompts that:
- Guide users to relevant content
- Answer common questions inline
- Reduce friction in the discovery process
- Collect implicit feedback on content quality

### 3. Dynamic Content Personalization

Returning visitors see:
- Content related to their previous interests
- Updated information on topics they explored
- Personalized calls-to-action
- Streamlined navigation paths

### 4. Agentic Chat Interface

Our chat system:
- Understands context from the current page
- Maintains conversation memory across sessions
- Escalates to humans seamlessly when needed
- Learns from every interaction

## Technical Architecture

### Front-End

- Next.js for server-side rendering
- React for dynamic components
- Tailwind for rapid styling
- Vercel for deployment

### AI Layer

- LangChain for agent orchestration
- Multiple LLM providers for resilience
- Custom prompt engineering
- WebLLM for privacy-sensitive operations

### Data & Learning

- PostgreSQL for structured data
- Vector database for semantic search
- Analytics for behavior tracking
- Feedback loops for improvement

## Results

### Lead Quality

- **95%** spam eliminated
- **40%** increase in qualified leads
- **50%** faster qualification cycle

### User Experience

- **30%** longer average session
- **25%** more pages per visit
- **Higher** returning visitor rate

### Operational Efficiency

- **80%** of inquiries handled automatically
- **Faster** response times
- **Better** lead routing accuracy

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked

1. **Start simple** - MVP first, sophistication later
2. **Measure everything** - Data drives improvement
3. **Human fallback** - AI + human beats AI alone
4. **Continuous iteration** - Ship weekly improvements

### What Didn't Work

1. **Over-personalization** - Can feel creepy if obvious
2. **Complex flows** - Simple usually wins
3. **Too much AI** - Sometimes static content is fine
4. **Ignoring edge cases** - Failures damage trust

## Try It Yourself

As you browse our site, you're experiencing these principles in action:
- The chat is AI-powered
- The contact form is intelligently filtered
- Content recommendations are personalized
- Navigation adapts to your behavior

We built this to demonstrate what's possible. If you like what you experience, imagine what we could build for your business.
